# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Through reflection, I recognised the need to write more code actively rather than passively consuming content. Additionally, I’ve learned to connect programming concepts with my own experiences and observations, which helps reinforce understanding and retain information more effectively.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I’ve noticed that the way programming is taught here is quite different from my previous school, so I need to adjust to a more hands-on and independent learning style.
Sometimes I just code randomly to get something working, but I want to improve how I apply what I’ve learned. Also, I tend to spend too much time on tasks, so I need to focus on better time management and not get stuck over small details.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

So far, I’ve been actively completing practicals, following instructions, and using Git properly. I’ve also made sure to test my code regularly, which helps me find and fix problems early. I will keep writing and experimenting with code to improve my understanding, and continue asking questions or reviewing examples when I get stuck.



## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop using code or functions that haven’t been taught in the subject. Sometimes I try to use advanced or unfamiliar features from online sources, but that often makes my code harder to debug or explain. I should focus more on using what we’ve learned and making sure I understand the basics well.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
I suggest offering more opportunities for students to get involved in research or learn about cutting-edge technologies. It would be helpful to have more chances to explore areas like AI, cloud computing, or cybersecurity beyond the standard curriculum, even in simple ways.
